# Django Project Template [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cirlabs/django-project-template.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/cirlabs/django-project-template) [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/cirlabs%2Fdjango-project-template.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/gh/cirlabs%2Fdjango-project-template)

Django Project Template is a collection of development tasks and optimizations aimed at anyone doing news application development on tight deadlines in Django. Highlights include:

- Works with our custom built [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/cirlabs/generator-newsapp) for even faster front-end scaffolding, development and optimization with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) (__recommended__)
- [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) setup for geospatial database work
- [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) tasks for development, building and deployment
- Preconfigured with [Django Compressor](http://django-compressor.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for CSS and JS preprocessing, concatenation and minification
- Preconfigured deploy chain for baking projects flat with [Django Bakery](http://django-bakery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- [Boto](http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/) configuration for easy deployment to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
- `lib` directory with some of our favorite code snippets and custom Django mangement commands

## Minimum Requirements
This project supports Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and Mac OS X Yosemite. It is not tested or supported for the Windows OS.

- [Django 1.7+](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [PostgreSQL 9.3+](http://www.postgresql.org/)
- [PostGIS 2.1+](http://postgis.net/)
- [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
- (optional) [Node.js 0.12.x](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js 1.2.x](https://iojs.org/en/index.html)

## Quickstart
```bash
$ mkvirtualenv project_name
$ pip install django fabric
$ django-admin.py startproject --extension=py,.gitignore --template=https://github.com/cirlabs/django-project-template/archive/master.zip project_name
$ cd project_name
$ fab bootstrap # bootstrap project
```

### Using Yeoman, Grunt and Bower (__recommended__)
While this template works fine out the box, it's recommended you use use our yeoman generator to manage your static assets (HTML, CSS, JS). We built [generator-newsapp](https://github.com/cirlabs/generator-newsapp) to work in concert with this project template. For this to work you'll need [Node.js 0.12.x](http://nodejs.org/) or [io.js 1.2.x](https://iojs.org/).

After running the quick start above run `fab scaffold` to install the required node.js libraries and generate the templates needed for frontend development.

**Note**: If you already have the npm modules installed, you can skip installing them by running `fab scaffold:skip-install`.

## Deployment
This project assumes you have an Amazon S3 bucket where you host your apps. They are static apps with no database calls.

Update `settings/production.py` with the various s3 buckets you'll use. We have buckets for staging (testing the application), buckets for media assets and a final bucket publishing. You can use these conventions or change them. You'll also need to add the [Django Bakery views](http://django-bakery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/gettingstarted.html#configuration) you want generated.

You'll also need to create a `settings/local_settings.py` file with your AWS secret key and ID. By default this file __will not__ be checked into version control. Keep it that way just in case your open source your project. This ensures you keys won't leak out to the world.

With those files configured, run `fab deploy` to publish your application to the world.

#### On database- and server-powered applications
You can certainly use this template for dynamic applications that use a live server and a database, but currently there is no deployment chain pre-configured at this time.

### PostGIS
By default, this project assumes you'll be using PostGIS as your database. If you'd prefer not to, you can set the `USE_POSTGIS` variable in `settings/common.py` to `False` and the project will default to PostgreSQL. :warning: Be sure to do this BEFORE running the quickstart.

### Tasks

### A note about GeoDjango deployment on Heroku
- If you're creating a GeoDjango application on Heroku, you're going to need geospatial libraries like GDAL and PostGIS. Luckily, CIR is here to help. Read more about our GeoDjango buildpack here: [cirlabs/heroku-buildpack-geodjango](https://github.com/cirlabs/heroku-buildpack-geodjango)

### Thanks
Special thanks goes to Chase Davis for his initial work at developing our Django template for CIR. Also, this project's structure borrows many great ideas from Ben Welsh at the Los Angeles Times Datadesk and his [Django Project Template](https://github.com/datadesk/django-project-template).
